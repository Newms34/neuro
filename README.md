##Purpose
This is a simple neuron simulation app, written to explore emergent phenomena from simple neural networks. It is still *very* much a work-in-progress! 

##Installation and Running
 1. Run `npm install` to set everything up.
 2. Start the server with `npm start`.
 3. Go to `localhost:8080` and play around.
 4. Enter a number of starting neurons, then toggle on at least ONE input. 
 5. Watch!
 6. The simulation ends when one of three situations occurs:
  - There are no more active neurons (lack of brain activity).
  - Over 75% of the neurons are active (overheating).
  - The control box is unchecked.

#Other Notes
 - Uncheck the checkbox at any time to halt the simulation.
 - Try different neuron numbers for different behavior.
